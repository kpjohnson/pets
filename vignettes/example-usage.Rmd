# Background

The `{pets}` package was designed to allow people to express their feelings about pets. At present, the package is rather cat-centric, in that it only contains one function: `cats()`.

# Usage

To use `{pets}`, first load the package and then call the function `cats()` with a logical/boolean argument. For example, 

```{r setup}
## load pets package
library(pets)

## if you love cats
cats(TRUE)

## if you're not a big fan of cats
cats(FALSE)
```
